Assignment 3

There are two directories along with this README in the program3 directory:
Client_Side
Server_Side

The files thats are contained in the Client_Side directory are the following:
Makefile
myftp.c

The files that are contained in the Server_Side directory are the following:
Makefile
myftpd.c

In order to compile and execute the server side code in the Server_Side directory, please run the following commands:

make clean
make
./myftpd <port_number>

<port_number> = the number of the port you will use for both the client and server

For example:
./myftpd 41012

In order to compile and execute the client side code in the Client_Side directory, please run the following commands:

make clean
make
./myftp <server_name> <port_number>

<server_name> = Name of the host i.e. student02.cse.nd.edu
<port_number> = Same port number that the server uses

For Example:
./client_side student02.cse.nd.edu 41012

In order to run this program correctly, please start the server first and then start the client. After both the server and the client are started, please follow the command prompts on both the server and client sides. The client will accept the following commands:
REQ-Request
UPL-Upload
DEL-Delete
MKD-Make Directory
RMD-Remove Directory
CHD-Change Directory
LIS-List
XIT-Exit

After entering a command to the client side, follow the instructions on the client side to complete the task.
